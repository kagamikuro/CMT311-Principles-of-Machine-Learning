Outline Description of Module:
Machine learning is a subfield of AI that studies methods for developing computer programs that learn from examples or from prior experience. This module provides an introduction to foundational aspects of the field. It covers probabilistic graphical models as a prominent approach for handling uncertainty in AI commonly used for instance in diagnostics, as well as their combination with approaches for reasoning and learning in relational domains. The module further covers the basics of learning theory, which provides a formal framework to assess the conditions under which machine learning algorithms can successfully achieve their tasks.

On completion of the module a student should be able to:
Reflect on and explain the role of and need for uncertainty in AI systems.
Assess the key concepts and algorithms underlying probabilistic graphical models.
Apply basic algorithms to toy examples.
Critically reflect and evaluate different inference approaches for graphical models.
Explain how reasoning about uncertainty can be combined with reasoning and learning in relational domains.
Describe basic principles of learning theory.
How the module will be delivered:
The module will use a combination of lectures, tutorials and labs. Lectures will be used to teach principles and methodologies, while tutorials and labs provide the students with opportunities to practice those, using either pen & paper exercises or software as appropriate.

Skills that will be practised and developed:
Formal thinking and modelling

Understanding of expressivity – efficiency trade-off in AI

Ability to understand mathematical theories, their assumptions and consequences

How the module will be assessed:
Module assessment will be 30% coursework and 70% written exam.

The coursework will allow the student to demonstrate their knowledge and practical skills and to apply the principles taught in lectures in the context of concrete applications of probabilistic models. The coursework assesses learning outcomes 2, 3, 5.

The exam will test the student's knowledge and understanding as elaborated under the learning outcomes (1-6).

Students will be provided with reassessment opportunities in line with University regulations.
